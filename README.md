# Pics

##### A React application which displays images to the user based on the search term. 

###### How it Works

A user can type a search *term* in the text input at the very top of the screen. After that, a search can be made for images by pressing enter. This will trigger a network request over to the **Unsplash API** which is going to find the pictures that match the search *term* that was entered. The ten different sized images fetched from the API will be displayed as tiles across the screen using CSS. 

This App is created with ***create-react-app*** and is deployed with ***Netlify***.
